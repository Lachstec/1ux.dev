Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Leon, a computer science student from Germany that is interested in a lot of technical topics, especially low level programming, networking and computer games. I post on this site about topics that currently pique my interest or that are currently happening. Down below, you can find links to my personal GitHub and other things.
